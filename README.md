# Ramda Lens

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/ramda/ramda-lens.svg?branch=master)

This library is an implementation of profunctor optics using JS, heavily
influenced by the [PureScript Profunctor Lenses][1] and [Kmett's Lens][2]
libraries.

The project is still very young and as such, documentation is currently
a work-in-progress. In the mean time, please feel free to drop by the
[Ramda room][3] on Gitter for any questions or further discussion.
